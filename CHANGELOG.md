# 0.8.0 (2023-04-30)

This is our biggest release yet!

### Features

Chat is by-far the biggest addition to Knowledge. Take a look at some of the awesome features we've added!

#### Knowledge + Chat

- Chat with any Source or Project
    - Source chat allows you to chat with a website, PDF file, or any other source
    - Project chat allows you to chat with a project, which includes all of the Sources in that project
- Automatic Introductions
    - When you chat with a Source or Project for the first time, Knowledge will automatically introduce you to it
    - This introduction includes a brief description of the Source or Project, as well as a list of the most important
      concepts
- Automatic Question Suggestions
    - When you chat with a Source or Project, Knowledge will automatically suggest questions to ask
    - These questions are based on the concepts in the Source or Project
- Chat Messages and Features
    - Highlight message text
    - Extract topics from a message
    - Save the message to the Notes section
    - Regenerate any message, no matter where you are in the Chat history
    - Continue a message that was previously interrupted
    - Edit or delete any message
    - Give a message a üëç or üëé rating to maximize your chat context window
    - TLDR a message to get a summary of it
    - ELI5 a message to get an explanation of it
- Created a secure method for entering your OpenAI API key to use the new Chat features
- Added a new Chat section in the `Settings` menu to configure your chat settings
- Added an Express server to handle the OpenAI API calls and prevent the API key from being exposed in the front-end (
  API Key is encrypted on disk)

#### Source and Project Features

- Changed Source `description` to `notes` to better reflect its purpose
- And with that change comes the ability to use `Markdown` in Source notes (finally)!
- Save webpage as PDF with a single button press
- Lots of new sample Sources (Surprise Me) that highlight the power of Knowledge + Chat
- Add Project breadcrumbs to the bottom of the Source and Project info views
- Removed the Projects view in favor of using the details view by right-clicking in the Projects tree

#### Style

- Source info pages now use a tab system for a cleaner look and feel
- The Project creation dialog has better proportions and a cleaner look
- Improved and expanded upon the initial tutorial

### Fixes and Improvements

- Tons of refactoring, decoupling, and code cleanup. Moved several components into their own files, and made the code
  much more readable and maintainable
- Fixed a bug where the size of the Source preview was not being calculated correctly when the normal window was zoomed
  in or out
- Removed automatic scroll to Project in the Project tree when expanding/collapsing non-active Project
- Added ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting (and fixed all the issues they found)
