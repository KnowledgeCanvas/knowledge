# Description

Knowledge is an open-source bookmark manager, file explorer, calendar, and project management tool. Knowledge allows users to import, organize, filter, and search nearly any
digital resource, including files, web links, calendar entries, and more. Create your own personal knowledge base, visualize connections between projects and resources, easily
extract content from documents, and review a timeline of your progress and activity.

# Security and Privacy

The app relies exclusively on local storage and local processes. There are no servers involved (except an _optional_ local Docker instance of Tika Server) and local documents never
leave your computer. Future versions may include opt-in reporting services to enhance functionality and improve support.

As of Feb 2022, there is a good chance that _something_ in the app is not working properly, simply because it has not been fully implemented yet. No extensive testing has been
conducted on Windows or Linux. It is very likely that something is broken on one or both of those platforms. Testing and verification on either platform is welcome.
